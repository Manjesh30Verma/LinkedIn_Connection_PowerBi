Hard Work Pays Off,This project is based on the data of the students and how they performed in the evaluation exam. And I have implemented Linear Regression for finding out the minimum time required for each student to do coding daily. R2 Score is used for calculating the accuracy and I got 99% accuracy. ,,Jul 2019,Jul 2019

Diabetics Detection,"This project is modeled using the KNN and the dataset used is of people of any country having high diabetics patients and the goal is to find out that the patient is diabetic or not on testing data, I have used binary classifier for classifying the possibility. ",,Aug 2019,Aug 2019
Titanic Survivor Prediction using Decision Trees,"Titanic Survivor is the very first question on Kaggle. In this problem, I have used decision trees for predicting whether a person will survive or not on the testing data.",,,
Bollywood Word Analogies,"In this project, I have worked with the Word2Vec model for finding the analogies of the word, i.e, used to complete the sentence “a is to b and c is to __”. The goal is to find out the correct word, I have measured the cosine similarity of the word vectors of (b-a) and (v-c). Here, v is the list of word vectors present in the vocab of the word2vec model. ",,,
Odd one out,"This project works to find out the odd one out, i.e, the least similar element out from any inputted list. Word2Vec model using Gensim(pre-trained model)is used for word embedding(vector representation of the words) ",,,
Image Classification using SVM,"I have worked on a support vector machine for extracting the features from the training dataset containing images of dog, cat, horse, and humans of around 800. Applying data augmentation for increasing the size of the dataset and using SVM for classifying the testing set into 4 classes. ",,,
Text Generation using Markov Chain,I have worked on a probabilistic model for text/natural language generation. Using the Markov Chain algorithm for generating the text up to a certain length.,,,
Emoji Prediction using LSTM,"This project is based on sensing the right emoji from the set of emoji according to the sentiment of the piece of line. While modeling the neural network, I have used LSTM for it with activation function softmax and GloVe ( Global Vector For Word representation), which is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining the vector representation of words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space. Adam is used for optimizing the model, the loss is categorical cross-entropy. ",,,
Sentimental Analysis using MLP on IMDB Dataset,"I have worked on the IMDB dataset for checking the sentiment of the reviews given by the reviewers either the review are positive or negative which to lead to giving the movie rating out of 5. I have also implemented the concept of early stopping, to overcome the overfitting problem.",,,
Sentimental Analysis using LSTM on IMDB Dataset,This project is similar to Sentimental analysis using MLP but this time I have used LSTM.,,,
Cartpole Playing Game using Reinforcement Learning,"A Cartpole (prebuild API by OpenAI GYM) is placed in the one-dimensional track having a pole which can move either left or right. The goal is to make the left and the right momentum in such a way that the pole does not fall down from a certain angle. So, I have used the GYM library for importing the Cartpole model and Q- learning principle to design the algorithm for constantly making momentum of the pole to achieve the highest accuracy. ",,,
Rock Paper Scissor,It's a simple rock paper scissor game deployed using flask having the three difficulty level.,https://github.com/erickeagle/rock-paper-scissor,Apr 2020,Apr 2020
Optimizing the time of the String Matching on large dataset,"It's very difficult to deal with the large dataset for match the string with the traditional libraries like Fuzzy Wuzzy, ftfy,Levenshtein,etc. For example, We are matching from two file each having 10k entries then if we want to perform string matching between two columns of each files, taking only 100 entries from first file and second file is consumed fully and store the percent similarity and matched entry on the first file. Then for Fuzzy-Wuzzy,if it took 15 seconds in my system (Configuration of my system is i7 8th generation processor having 8 GB Ram and 4 GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050ti.), when I am utilizing the GPU. If we take whole file then the consumed is approx is 1500 seconds and if our data is lakhs then the time consumed is much high. Then in place of Fuzzy-Wuzzy we can match the strings using the NLP Algorithm which is based on n-grams and tf-idf which can match both the file in one go in appox 8-10 sec. Which is really-really fast than any other string matching package.",https://github.com/erickeagle/String-Matching,May 2020,May 2020
Telco Customer Churn dataset using PyCaret," I have done the visualizing the dataset, cleaning the dataset and making the data type from objests to categorical, dropping the useless informaion then using the pycaret library to train the dataset on number of classification algorithms at much faster rate.",https://github.com/erickeagle/Pycaret-on-Telco-churn-dataset,May 2020,May 2020

HR Analytics,"HR Analytics, as the name suggests is the tool for HR to suggest the top 10 jobs from the dataset based on the skills of the person. There are two versions of this tool. In the First version, I have used pyreparser for extracting the skills from the resume and the second version is manually providing the skills as the input. Both have there UI based on their input type. The dataset is created via scrapping of the glassdoor website using selenium and beautiful soup, around 1923 jobs are extracted. And for matching the job description and the skills, I have used the NLP algorithm which is based on n-grams, tf-idf, and KNN is used for finding the best jobs for the person. At last deployed both the version using Flask and rendering is done using simple html templates.",https://github.com/erickeagle/HR-Analytics,Mar 2020,Apr 2020
